            <br><b><mark>Lucknow</mark></b>, is a <a href="#">metropolis</a> and the second largest city of the  <mark><b>Indian state</b></mark>,of Uttar Pradesh where it serves as the capital and the administrative headquarters of the eponymous district and division. The city had a population of 2.8 million according to the 2011 census making it the eleventh most populous city and the twelfth-most populous urban agglomeration of India.[9] It is an important centre of education, commerce, aerospace, finance, pharmaceuticals, information technology, design, culture, tourism, music, and poetry.[10][11][12] Lucknow, along with Agra and Varanasi, forms the backbone of the Uttar Pradesh Heritage Arc.

In the 6th century BCE, Lucknow was part of Kosala, one of the 16 Mahajanapadas during the late Vedic period. The Nawabs of Lucknow acquired the name after the reign of the third Nawab when Lucknow became their capital. In 1856, the East India Company first moved its troops to the border, then annexed the state for alleged maladministration. Awadh was placed under a chief commissioner. Lucknow was one of the major centres of the Indian Rebellion of 1857 and actively participated in India's independence movement, emerging as a strategically important North Indian city. The city witnessed some of the pivotal moments in the history of India including the first meeting of Mahatma Gandhi, Jawaharlal Nehru and Muhammad Ali Jinnah during the Congress session of 1916 when Lucknow Pact was signed.

Lucknow is ranked sixth in 2023, a list of the ten fastest growing job-creating cities in India.[13][14] Multiple software and IT companies are present in the city. Lucknow is an emerging automobile hub.[15] Lucknow has been the headquarters of the Central Command of the Indian Army.[16] It is the home of several prominent educational and research institutes and universities including the Indian Institute of Management Lucknow, the Indian Institute of Information Technology, Lucknow, AKTU and the Central Drug Research Institute.
<hr><br><section id="Etymology"><h2>Etymology</h2><br></section>
Main article: Names for Lucknow <br><br>"Lucknow" is the anglicised spelling of the local pronunciation "Lakhnau". According to one legend, the city is named after Lakshmana, a hero of the Hindu epic Ramayana. The legend states that Lakshmana had a palace or an estate in the area, which was called Lakshmanapuri (Sanskrit: ‡§≤‡§ï‡•ç‡§∑‡•ç‡§Æ‡§£‡§™‡•Å‡§∞‡•Ä, lit. Lakshmana's city). The settlement came to be known as Lakhanpur (or Lachhmanpur) by the 11th century, and later, Lucknow.[17][18]

A similar theory states that the city was known as Lakshmanavati (Sanskrit: ‡§≤‡§ï‡•ç‡§∑‡•ç‡§Æ‡§£‡§µ‡§§‡•Ä, fortunate) after Lakshmana. The name changed to Lakhanavati, then Lakhnauti and finally Lakhnau.[19] Yet another theory states that the city's name is connected with Lakshmi, the Hindu goddess of wealth. Over time, the name changed to Laksmanauti, Laksmnaut, Lakhsnaut, Lakhsnau and, finally, Lakhnau.[20]

Another theory is that Lucknow was named after a very influential architect named Lakhna Ahir, who built the fort Qila Lakhna.[21][22]




<br><hr><br><section id="History"><h2>History</h2><br>Main article: History of Lucknow<br><br><h3>Ancient Lucknow</h3><br>From the sixth to the fourth century BCE, Lucknow was part of the realm of Kosala, one of the 16 Mahajanapadas in the Late Vedic period. From 1350 onwards, Lucknow and parts of the Awadh region were ruled by the Delhi Sultanate, Sharqi Sultanate, Mughal Empire, Nawabs of Awadh, the British East India Company and the British Raj.
    For about eighty-four years (from 1394 to 1478), Awadh was part of the Sharqi Sultanate of Jaunpur. Emperor Humayun made it a part of the Mughal Empire around 1555. Emperor Jahangir (1569‚Äì1627) granted an estate in Awadh to a favoured nobleman, Sheikh Abdul Rahim, who later built Machchi Bhawan on this estate. It later became the seat of power from where his descendants, the Sheikhzadas, controlled the region.[23] The Nawabs of Lucknow acquired the name after the reign of the third Nawab when Lucknow became their capital. The city became North India's cultural capital, and its nawabs, best remembered for their refined and extravagant lifestyles, were patrons of the arts.
    Under their dominion, music and dance flourished, and construction of numerous monuments took place.[24] Of the monuments standing today, the Bara Imambara, the Chota Imambara, and the Rumi Darwaza are notable examples. One of the Nawab's enduring legacies is the region's syncretic Hindu‚ÄìMuslim culture that has come to be known as the Ganga-Jamuni Tehzeeb.[25]


Chota Imambara is a Shia Muslim Hussainiya and a mausoleum for Muhammad Ali Shah.
Until 1719, the subah of Awadh was a province of the Mughal Empire administered by a governor appointed by the emperor. Persian adventurer Saadat Khan, also known as Burhan-ul-Mulk, was appointed Nizam of Awadh in 1722 and established his court in Faizabad, near Lucknow.[26]

Many independent kingdoms, such as Awadh, were established as the Mughal Empire disintegrated. The third Nawab, Shuja-ud-Daula (r. 1753‚Äì1775), fell out with the British after aiding the fugitive Nawab of Bengal, Mir Qasim. Roundly defeated at the Battle of Buxar by the East India Company, he was forced to pay heavy penalties and surrender parts of his territory.[27] Awadh's capital, Lucknow rose to prominence when Asaf-ud-Daula, the fourth Nawab, shifted his court to the city from Faizabad in 1775.[28] The British East India Company appointed a resident (ambassador) in 1773 and by early 19th century gained control of more territory and authority in the state.

They were, however, disinclined to capture Awadh outright and come face to face with the Maratha Empire and the remnants of the Mughal Empire. In 1798, the fifth Nawab Wazir Ali Khan alienated both his people and the British and was forced to abdicate. The British then helped Saadat Ali Khan take the throne.[29] He became a puppet king, and in a treaty of 1801, yielded large part of Awadh to the East India Company while also agreeing to disband his own troops in favour of a hugely expensive, British-controlled army.

Situated in the middle of the Indus-Gangetic Plain, the city is surrounded by rural towns and villages: the orchard town of Malihabad, Kakori, Mohanlalganj, Gosainganj, Chinhat and Itaunja. To the east lies Barabanki, to the west Unnao, to the south Raebareli, while to the north lie the Sitapur and Hardoi. Lucknow city is located in a seismic zone III.[40]

Bounded on the east by Barabanki, on the west by Unnao, on the south by Raebareli and in the north by Sitapur and Hardoi, Lucknow sits on the northwestern shore of the Gomti River. As of 2008, there were 110 wards in the city. Morphologically, three clear demarcations exist: The central business district, which is a fully built up area, comprises Hazratganj, Aminabad and Chowk. A middle zone surrounds the inner zone with concrete houses while the outer zone consists of villages.[42]

<hr><br><section id="Politics"><h2>Politics</h2><br>Lucknow is the capital of Uttar Pradesh, a key political center in India, historically and presently, with its politics dominated by the BJP, especially since 1991 when it became a stronghold for the party following the rise of Atal Bihari Vajpayee, who represented the city in Parliament for many years. The city is a significant Lok Sabha constituency and has seen a major political legacy, with the BJP holding its seat consistently. In the broader context of Uttar Pradesh politics, the Chief Minister is based in Lucknow, and the city is the center for state-level administration and governance.
    Importance. The Lucknow Pact was seen as a beacon of hope to Hindu‚ÄìMuslim unity. It was the first time that the Hindus and Muslims had made a joint demand for political reform to the British. It led to a growing belief in British India that Home Rule (self-government) was a real possibility.

<hr><br><section id="Economy"><h2>Economy</h2><br>The major industries in the Lucknow urban agglomeration include aeronautics, automotive, machine tools, distillery chemicals, furniture and Chikan embroidery.[58] Lucknow is among the top cities of India by GDP.[59] It is a centre for research and development as home to the R&D centres of the National Milk Grid of the National Dairy Development Board, the Central Institute of Medical and Aromatic Plants, the National Handloom Development Corporation and U.P. Export Corporation.[60] Lucknow is ranked sixth in a list of the ten fastest growing job-creating cities in India according to a study conducted by Assocham Placement Pattern,[13] Lucknow's economy was formerly based on the tertiary sector and the majority of the workforce were employed as government servants. Large-scale industrial establishments are few compared to other northern Indian state capitals like New Delhi. The economy is growing with contributions from the fields of IT, manufacturing and processing and medical/biotechnology. Business-promoting institutions such as the CII have set up their service centres in the city.[14] Major export items are marbled products, handicrafts, art pieces, gems, jewellery, textiles, electronics, software products, computers, hardware products, apparel, brass products, silk, leather goods, glass items and chemicals. Lucknow has promoted public-private partnerships in sectors such as electricity supply, roads, expressways, and educational ventures.[61]
    Traditionally, Lucknow has been a mandi town for mangoes, melons, and grains grown in the surrounding areas.[73] Sugarcane-growing plantations and sugar industries are also in close proximity. This attracted Edward Dyer to set up a unit based on molasses in the city. Dyer Breweries was incorporated in 1855 and was Asia's first commercial brewery. The company name was changed to Mohan Meakin Brewery in 1967 (the word "Breweries" was dropped in the eighties as the company diversified into other industries).[74]

Lucknow is famous for its small scale industries that are based on unique styles of embroidery, namely, Chikan and Lakhnawi Zardozi, both of which are significant foreign exchange earners. Chikan has caught the fancy of fashion designers in Bollywood and abroad.[75] It is very popular in Indian markets and have very high demand.
During the period of the Nawabs, kite-making reached a high level of artistry,[76] and is still a small-scale industry.
The Ministry of Communications and Information Technology set up Software Technology Parks of India[77] in 2001. Currently, biotechnology and information technology are the two focus areas to promote economic development in and around the city.[73] The Ministry of Science and Technology is setting up a biotech park[78] in the city. Lucknow is also one of the selected cities for the Smart City project of STPI.

The city is being developed on the lines of Delhi's National Capital Region and will be the headquarters of the Uttar Pradesh State Capital Region or Lucknow State Capital Region.[79] It will be developed as the country's first AI City and the largest IT hub in the country.[80][81] It ranks 7th in the state as per GDP per capita.[82] Lucknow is also being set to manufacture Bramhos Missile with the establishment of two Defence Research and Development Organisation (DRDO) centres.[83][84] Lucknow region is emerging as a key industrial and logistics hub in North India after Delhi-NCR as the warehousing sector.[85]

<hr><br><section id="Culture"><h2>Culture</h2><br>See also: Ganga-Jamuni tehzeeb<br>In common with other metropolitan cities across India, Lucknow is multicultural and multilingual.[177][178] Many of the cultural traits and customs peculiar to Lucknow have become living legends today. The city's contemporary culture is the result of the amalgamation of the Hindu and Muslim rulers who ruled the city simultaneously. The credit for this goes to the secular and syncretic traditions of the Nawabs of Awadh, who took a keen interest in every walk of life and encouraged these traditions to attain a rare degree of sophistication. Modern-day Lucknowites are known for their polite and polished way of speaking which is noticed by visitors. The residents of Lucknow call themselves Lucknowites or Lakhnavi.[179] It also represents the melting pot of globalisation where the legacy of Nawab's culture continues to be reflected in the traditional vocabulary of the Urdu language of the city along with better avenues for modernisation present here.[citation needed]

The Urdu language is also a part of Lucknowi culture and heritage. It is mostly used by wealthier families, the remaining members of the royal family as well as in Urdu poetry and on public signs. The government has taken many innovative steps to promote Urdu.[182] Awadhi, a dialect of the Hindi dialect continuum, is the native dialect of Lucknow and has played an important role in Lucknow's history and is still used in the city's rural areas and by the urban population on the streets.[183]</p>

Since ages, the Bawarchis (chefs) and Rakabdars (royal chefs) have developed great finesse in cooking and presentation of food, under royal patronage. This gave rise to the art of cooking over a slow fire (or Dum style cooking), which has become synonymous with "Awadhi" cuisine. These Bawarchis added elaborately prepared dishes like kababs, kormas, kaliya, nahari-kulchas, zarda, sheermal, roomali rotis and warqi parathas to the traditional "Awadhi" dastarkhwaan (feast of dishes).[189] The best-known dishes of this area consist of biryanis, kebabs and breads. Kebabs are served in a variety of styles; kakori, galawati, shami, boti, patili-ke, ghutwa and seekh are among the available varieties.[189] Tunde ke kabab restaurants are popular for a type of soft kebab developed by a one-armed chef (hence the name Tunday) for a Nawab who had lost his teeth.[190] The reputation of Lucknow's kebabs is not limited to the local population and the dish attracts people from other cities as well as other countries.[191]

It was originally built to provide assistance to people affected by the deadly famine, which struck the whole of Uttar Pradesh in the same year.[168] It is the largest hall in Asia without any external support from wood, iron or stone beams.[169] The monument required approximately 22,000 labourers during construction.[170]
